# MC-simulation-of-phase-change

Monte Carlo simulation of phase change for simple cubic lattice. This is my course project for "Computational Physics".

The implementation is based on test-driven development (TDD). I used catch2 to design test cases to verify the correctness of my code during my devolopment. You can find them in the UnitTests directory.
