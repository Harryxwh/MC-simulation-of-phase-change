# MC-simulation-of-phase-change

Monte Carlo simulation of phase change for simple cubic lattice. This is my course project for "Computational Physics".

[FinalPre.pdf](https://1drv.ms/b/c/d25b8d2fbda10eb1/EbEOob0vjVsggNISBAAAAAABTqJakvsZkqnbRTpiXD-jyQ?e=eAszUI) is my presentation for the course, explaining the implementation process briefly and demonstrating the results.

The implementation is based on test-driven development (TDD). I used catch2 to design test cases to verify the correctness of my code during my development. You can find them in the UnitTests directory.
