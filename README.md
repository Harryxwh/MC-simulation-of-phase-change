# MC-simulation-of-phase-change
Monte Carlo simulation of phase change for simple cubic lattice. This is my course project for "Computational Physics".
FinalPre.pdf is my presentation for the course, explaining the implementation process briefly and demonstatrating the results.
The implementation is based on test-driven development (TDD). I used catch2 to design test cases to verify the correctness of my code during my devolopment. You can find them in the UnitTests directory.
